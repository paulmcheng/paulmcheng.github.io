My personal web site, based off the http://html5up.net/spectral design by
[@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn).
The site is made for blog and portfolio content. The blog can contain both
personal entries and entries by syndicated authors.
The site uses jekyll, a method of creating and maintaining a web site,
which works by using local templates to generate static files that you upload
and sync with your remote site.
